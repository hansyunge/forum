# forum

Learn PHP / HTML / CSS all at the same time, thought I'd try to tackle creating a simple forum from scratch... I'd like to use it on a simple website I'm creating.  Help with stated bugs is much appreciated, tips on style, security or other tips of the trade is always welcome as well.  My first error on this project was using a PHP tutorial teaching from PHP 4.x, evidently we are now on 8.x... so yeah.  Thanks again!
